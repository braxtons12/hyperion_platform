hyperion::platform
**************

hyperion::platform is a foundational library for the Hyperion game engine, the core platform
and feature detection macros necessary to implement other parts of the engine and its related
libraries.

It's currently under active development and has not yet hit a stable release point.

hyperion::platform is not dependent on other parts of the engine and can be used freely,
separately from any other Hyperion projects.

See the :doc:`Quick Start Guide <quick_start>` for how to get started using hyperion::platform.
